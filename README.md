# David Attenborough Website
## Mission and Vision
I love David Attenborough so much it physically hurts. It makes me really sad that he is old but this website will be a token of my appreciation. The aim of this website is for you to play some fun mini games to earn money and collect David stickers. You can show your achievements to your friends so they know who the biggest David fan in the world is you! You can also apply to jobs on this website so you can work for me and be my rat <3 love u xx

More stickers and job postings coming soon!!!!!!
## Tech Stack
Backend: Express.js, mongoDB\
Frontend: pure html, css and javascript\

To run: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
\

I also used to be able transport it around with docker and kubernetes, but it's too expensive and I ran out of my free GCP credit :(
## How to use
To connect to the mongoDB clust run the following commands:
```
# assuming you are located in in same the directory as this application
$ cd server
$ node index.js
# use a live server to open any of the html files, without one the pages will not refresh.
    # the one I use is listed in 'Tech Stack'
# create an account if you don't already have one
```
## Appendix
Side note: don't use any sensitive passwords because I can see it xx\
Side side note: if it doesn't work that means mongoDB has paused my cluster :(
