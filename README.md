# David Attenborough Website
## Mission and Vision
I love David Attenborough so much it physically hurts. It makes me really sad that he is old but this website will be a token of my appreciation. The aim of this website is for you to play some fun mini games to earn money and collect David stickers. You can show your achievements to your friends so they know who the biggest David fan in the world is you! You can also apply to jobs on this website so you can work for me and be my rat <3 love u xx

More stickers and job postings coming soon!!!!!!
## Tech Stack
Backend: Express.js, mongoDB\
Frontend: pure html, css and javascript
\
\
It also technically can be transported around with docker and kubernetes, but it's too expensive so I no longer have any GCP credit
## How to use
To connect to the mongoDB clust run the following commands:
```
# assuming you are located in in same the directory as this application
$ cd server
$ node index.js
# open any of the html files, you will automatically be redirected to the login page
# create an account if you don't already have one
```
## Appendix
Side note: don't use any sensitive passwords because I can see it xx\
Side side note: if it doesn't work that means mongoDB has paused my cluster :(
